<h1>Image Warping and Mosaicing - Part II</h1>

<div class="section">
<h2>B.1: Harris Corner Detection</h2>

<p>
  The images below show the detected Harris corners before and after applying ANMS (Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression). 
  The key parameters tuned for Harris corner detection were <code>sigma</code>, <code>min_distance</code>, 
  and <code>threshold_abs</code>, as used in the following functions:
  <br><br>
  <code>h = corner_harris(im, method='eps', sigma=1.5)</code><br>
  <code>coords = peak_local_max(h, min_distance=10, threshold_abs=0.01 * h.max())</code>
  <br><br>
  Better and more stable corners were observed after downsizing the image. 
  This improvement occurs because downsizing suppresses high-frequency noise and redundant texture variations, 
  enabling the Harris detector to respond primarily to strong, well-defined structural features. 
  It also results in a sharper and more distinct autocorrelation surface, 
  improving the separation between true corners and noisy edge responses.
  <br><br>
  Additionally, the image was histogram-equalized and lightly blurred to minimize sunlight effects 
  and suppress low-frequency illumination artifacts, ensuring consistent corner detection across regions with varying brightness.

<h2>B.2: Feature Descriptor Extraction</h2>
<p>The following image shows 6 descriptors which are preceded by original image patch around a feature on the left (40x40), the gaussian blurred outcome and the descriptor itself (8x8).</p>

<h2>B.3: Feature Matching</h2>
<p>
  The following images show the feature correspondences obtained through feature matching. 
  RANSAC was then applied to refine these matches and retain the most consistent correspondences 
  based on a normalized patch SSD threshold of 3.0 pixels.

<h2>B.4: RANSAC for Robust Homography</h2>
<p>
  The following images show the mosaic of three images created using feather blending, as described in Part 1. 
  While the overall structure aligns well, the mosaic is not perfect as visible ghosting and subtle artifacts remain 
  in regions with parallax, motion, or varying exposure. 
  These imperfections can be attributed to slight misalignments, illumination differences, and the linear nature of feather blending, 
  which may not fully account for geometric inconsistencies or intensity variations across overlapping regions.
