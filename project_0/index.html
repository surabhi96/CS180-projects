  <h1>Project 1: Focal Length and Perspective (iPhone 12)</h1>
  <p>
    This project explores how zoom levels (0.5× or 13mm to 1× or 23mm) on the iPhone 12 affects perspective. 
    Below are my results for Part 1 (selfies), Part 2 (architecture), and Part 3 (dolly zoom).
    Note: The iPhone 12 only has 2 optical zoom options at 0.5× and 1×. Therefore, the pictures below might have effects of 
    digital zoom. The lack of a good hardware results in the reduction in the efficacy of these experiments in 
    conveying the idea of the respective phenomenon.
  </p>

  <!-- Part 1 -->
  <div class="part">
    <h2>Part 1: Selfie – The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
    <p>
      For this section, I have captured photos of a toy at different zoom levels from the iPhone12 front camera. 
      The wide angle lens (0.5× or 13mm) produces distorted image (camera closest to toy), while stepping back a little and using higher zooms (closer to 1× or 23mm) produces 
      more natural portraits. These is because as the zoom is increased, the focal length increases which inturn reduces 
      the FOV. Reduced FOV results in a less distorted image. Therefore, the toy at 1x appears to be less strecthed or 
      distorted. By moving the camera backward as the zoom increases, the camera perspective also changes because of which the object size 
      appears to be the same in the images. If the camera were not zoomed in as the camera were shifted backwards, the 
      size of the object in the image would have shrunk. Therefore, zooming into the scene as the camera moves backward is the way to
      maintain the size of the object.

  <!-- Part 2 -->
  <div class="part">
    <h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
    <p>
      I repeated the procedure for an architectural scene. Wider zooms exaggerate 
      depth (0.5×), while higher zooms compress the scene (1×).

  <!-- Part 3 -->
  <div class="part">
    <h2>Part 3: The Dolly Zoom</h2>
    <p>
      I recreated the <em>dolly zoom</em> effect by moving the camera and adjusting zoom 
      simultaneously. In this case, I am moving forward as I zoom out of the scene. Hence, 
      the background appears to be shrinking inwards while the size of the foreground objects 
      (the two poles) remain similar. This is opposite to what was happening in part 1 (where I moved back and zoomed in).
